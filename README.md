Hello,
I attempted all tasks,
However, Here are the points to note;
-Note that in task 2, Name is not part of the data gotten from the API, so i used "country" column for  that.
-The data gotten fromthe API appears to have some duplicate property uuid. I tried to avoid duplicate entries. This reduced the number of rows in my db. Not sure if that was intended.

Further due to time constraints, there are a lot of features, functionalities and practices I would have loved to have implemented which includes but not limited to;
- Implementation of a fancy UserInterface using react js material UI, theme UIs and the likes.
- Since almost all functions were asynchronous, I also intended to add an indicator or prerloader for different ajax actions on the page.
- Finish Up with the google maps apif functionality.
- I know if I had the time to review my code, there are some implementations I would have carried out much more efficiently. Overall wise.
- Writing of appropriate tests such as Unit tests and integration tests. 
- I would also try to handle errors through a "Whoops something went wrong page, to prevent dislpaying errors on production".
- There are so many house keeping things that I might forgot to do, like moving my javscript files to a seperate page and indentation.
- Try to optimize the database operations in the following ways,
- Picking the most optimal data tyypes for storing values.
- Reduucing the usage of SELECT statements to reduce overall execution time.

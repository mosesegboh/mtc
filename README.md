Hello,
I attempted all tasks,
However, Here are the points to note;
-Note that in task 2, Name is not part of the data gotten from the API, so i used "country" column for  that.
-The data gotten fromthe API appears to have some duplicate property uuid. I tried to avoid duplicate entries. This reduced the number of rows in my db. Not sure if that was intended.

Furthermore, due to time constraints, there are a lot of features, functionalities and practices I would have loved to have implemented which includes but not limited to;
- Implementation of a more user friendly UI implementing some fancy UserInterface using react js, material UI, theme UIs and or vue js .
- Since almost all functions were asynchronous, I also intended to add an indicator or prerloader for different ajax actions on the page.
- I know if I had the time to review my code, there are some implementations I would have carried out much more efficiently. Overall wise. For example,if I had more time I could have implemented the base controller for most of the reapeted responses.
- Writing of appropriate tests such as Unit tests and integration tests utilizing tools like cypress and php unit.
- I would also try to handle errors through a "Whoops something went wrong page, to prevent dislpaying errors on production".
- There are so many house keeping things that I might forgot to do, like moving my javscript files to a seperate page and indentation.
- Try to optimize the database operations in the following ways,
- Picking the most optimal data tyypes for storing values.
- Reducing the usage of SELECT statements to reduce overall execution time.
